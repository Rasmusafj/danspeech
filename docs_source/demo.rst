We've create a demo to experience the danspeech package.

The demo is in the form of a local django development server with a nice GUI.

It depends on danspeech and django.

The demo resides at `DanSpeech demo <https://github.com/danspeech/danspeechdemo>`_. where you can read more on how
to use it.
