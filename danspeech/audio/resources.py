    The microphone audio is recorded in chunks of ``chunk_size`` samples, at a rate of ``sample_rate`` samples per second (Hertz). If not specified, the value of ``sample_rate`` is determined automatically from the system's microphone settings.

    Higher ``sample_rate`` values result in better audio quality, but also more bandwidth (and therefore, slower recognition). Additionally, some CPUs, such as those in older Raspberry Pi models, can't keep up if this value is too high.

    Higher ``chunk_size`` values help avoid triggering on rapidly changing ambient noise, but also makes detection less sensitive. This value, generally, should be left at its default.
