# Demo
To experience the danspeech package, we've created a simple demo with a nice GUI. 

The demo resides at [https://github.com/rasmusafj/danspeechdemo](https://github.com/rasmusafj/danspeechdemo).

# Train models
If you wish to train your own models, or perhaps finetune a DanSpeech model to your specific use case, we then 
referr to the DanSpeech training repository. 

# Support
If you require help with the software, then feel free to create issues here on github. We will continually solve issues
and answer any questions that you might have.
